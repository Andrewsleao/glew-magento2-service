To install, you'll need to be sure that your root `composer.json` file contains a reference to the Glew repository.  To do so, add the following to `composer.json`:

```json
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",                                                                                                              
            "url": "https://github.com/glewio/glew-magento2-service.git"
        }
    ]
```

The above can also be added using the Composer command line with the command: 

    composer config repositories.magento vcs https://github.com/glewio/glew-magento2-service.git
